# Gemini GUI - Project Summary

## What We've Built

We've created the foundation for Gemini GUI, an AI-powered IDE with integrated Gemini capabilities. The project is structured as an Electron desktop application that can be launched from the command line using `gemini-gui`.

### Current Features

1. **Electron Desktop Application**
   - Basic window management
   - VS Code-like dark theme interface
   - Runs from command line with `gemini-gui` command

2. **UI Layout**
   - File Explorer sidebar (placeholder)
   - Code Editor area
   - Terminal panel (placeholder)
   - AI Chat panel
   - Settings button (placeholder)

3. **Project Structure**
   ```
   gemini-gui/
   ├── electron/
   │   ├── main.js      # Main Electron process
   │   └── preload.js   # Preload script for security
   ├── src/             # React source (prepared for future)
   ├── public/
   │   └── icon.svg     # Application icon
   ├── index.html       # Main UI (currently vanilla JS)
   ├── gemini-gui       # CLI launcher script
   └── package.json     # Minimal dependencies
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the app: `npm start` or `./gemini-gui`

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Complete the React Integration
- Set up proper build system with Vite
- Migrate the vanilla HTML/JS to React components
- Implement state management with Zustand

### 2. Integrate Gemini API
- Add Google Generative AI SDK
- Implement API key management
- Create chat functionality with real AI responses

### 3. Implement Core Features
- **File Explorer**: Directory tree navigation
- **Code Editor**: Integrate CodeMirror with syntax highlighting
- **Terminal**: Integrate xterm.js for terminal emulation
- **Multi-Agent System**: Implement agent creation and management

### 4. Add Essential IDE Features
- File operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Multiple editor tabs
- Settings persistence with electron-store
- Workspace management

### 5. Polish and Distribution
- Proper error handling
- Loading states and UI feedback
- Build distributable packages for different platforms
- Auto-update functionality

## Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Dependency Installation**: Initial package.json had version conflicts. Simplified to minimal dependencies to get started.

2. **TypeScript Setup**: Full TypeScript configuration prepared but not yet active. Will need proper compilation setup.

3. **Build System**: Vite configuration prepared but requires all React dependencies to be installed first.

## How to Continue Development

1. **Install Full Dependencies**: Gradually add React and other dependencies, testing after each addition
2. **Migrate to React**: Convert the current HTML interface to React components
3. **Implement IPC**: Set up proper communication between main and renderer processes
4. **Add Gemini Integration**: Implement the actual AI functionality

The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development!
